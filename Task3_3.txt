Given the family emergency situation, it is important to prioritize and manage the pending tasks effectively. 
1. Evaluate the urgency and priority of both tasks: Task 2 is of higher priority and has a time-sensitive deadline, whereas Task 1 is of lower priority and does not have a specific go-live date. 
Hence, it is crucial to prioritize Task 2 and complete it before its due date.
2. Communicate the situation to customer : It is important to communicate the situation to both the customers involved and explain the delay in completing the tasks. 
It is essential to convey the urgency of Task 2 and the need for an extension to complete it.
3. Request an extension for Task 2: As Task 2 is time-sensitive and critical, it would be wise to request an extension for it. 
It is important to explain the situation and provide an estimated timeline for completing the task.
4. Re-organizing the workload: As there is a delay of at least 3 days, it is necessary to re-organize the workload and allocate the available time accordingly. 
This would involve re-prioritizing other pending tasks and rescheduling them as necessary.
5. Completing Task 1 within the available time: With Task 2 being the priority, it may not be possible to complete Task 1 within its original due date. 
However, as it is for a low-priority customer and does not have a specific go-live date, it can be completed within the extended timeline.
6. Monitor progress and communicate updates: It is essential to monitor the progress of both tasks and communicate regular updates to the stakeholders involved. 
This would help in managing their expectations and keeping them informed about the status of the pending tasks.
